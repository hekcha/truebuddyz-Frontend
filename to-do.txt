http://localhost:3000/quiz/view/1629295352940kshdbvjh     is showing webpage.....wrong link
createquiz.js and playquiz.js      fetch (${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/api/user/) for getting id of user  try to rmove for less server load
quiz response security (not to seen by other)
why we say sorry on result page its his faultðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
code generated need encription    try to convert it into base35
share button not working properly
remove all usecookies and pass tokens as parameter for fast response
validate token in frontend also
remove user field 

in playquiz.js try another method for good UI
	useEffect(() => {if (que && user && user === que.user) window.location.href = `/quiz/view/${que.code}`;}, [user, que]);
